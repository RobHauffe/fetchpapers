        "abstract": "Obesity-induced adipose tissue expansion is characterized by capillary rarefaction and hypoxia, which disrupts angiogenesis and impairs beige adipogenesis. While angiogenesis is known to be crucial for beiging, the functional link between impaired vascularization and defective browning remains poorly understood. How natural compounds like berberine (BBR) links angiogenesis with beige adipogenesis remains unexplored. Using both diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 J and leptin-deficient (ob/ob) murine models, we administered intraperitoneal BBR for 4 weeks. Adipose tissue remodeling was evaluated through histomorphometry, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. RNA sequencing of adipose tissue was performed to identify the potential targets. Chemical hypoxia was induced using CoCl₂ in preadipocytes to examine its effects on browning. BBR improved adipose tissue dysfunction in both the DIO model and the ob/ob model. It increased CD34<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial progenitor cells and enhanced protein levels of VEGF/VEGFR2, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and UCP-1, indicating simultaneous promotion of angiogenesis and adipose browning. Transcriptomic analysis revealed glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) as a novel target through which BBR alleviates adipose dysfunction. GPX3 knockdown in vivo impaired angiogenesis and suppressed browning markers. BBR reversed chemical hypoxia-induced impairment of beige adipocyte differentiation independently of UCP-1 upregulation by inhibiting HIF-1α activation. This study unveils that BBR counteracts obesity-associated adipose tissue dysfunction: it upregulates GPx3 to reduce oxidative stress, which in turn normalizes HIF-1α levels and activates the PRDM16 signaling, thereby concurrently restoring adipose angiogenesis and promoting beige adipogenesis. This breaks the vicious cycle of hypoxia-impaired angiogenesis and suppressed thermogenesis, positioning BBR as a promising multi-target therapy for obesity.",

        "analysis": "Here's a summary of the abstract in 3 bullet points, highlighting the specific mechanism:\n\n*   Berberine (BBR) improves obesity-associated adipose tissue dysfunction in murine models by simultaneously promoting adipose angiogenesis (increasing endothelial progenitor cells and VEGF/VEGFR2) and beige adipogenesis (enhancing PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and UCP-1 expression).\n*   The study identifies glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) as a novel and crucial target, demonstrating that BBR upregulates GPx3, and conversely, GPx3 knockdown in vivo impairs both angiogenesis and browning markers.\n*   BBR's overarching mechanism involves upregulating GPx3 to reduce oxidative stress, which then normalizes HIF-1α activation and activates the PRDM16 signaling pathway, thereby concurrently restoring adipose angiogenesis and promoting beige adipogenesis to break the vicious cycle of hypoxia-impaired dysfunction.",
