        "journal": "Journal of molecular histology",
        "abstract": "Many investigations have indicated the significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for early obesity in children. MiR-874-3p was revealed to be downregulated in overweight/obese children. However, the specific function and mechanism of miR-874-3p in the progression of childhood obesity remain unclear. Human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) to establish an in vitro cell model. CCK-8 assay and ELISA were used to assess cell viability and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, respectively. RT-qPCR was used for miR-874-3p expression analysis. Western blotting was utilized to evaluate protein levels of miR-874-3p downstream targets and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling-related markers. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the binding relation between miR-874-3p and nucleolin (NCL). MiR-874-3p overexpression attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced inhibition of cell viability and promotion of proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanistically, NCL served as a target of miR-874-3p, and overexpressing miR-874-3p inactivated NCL-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling. Moreover, NCL upregulation reversed miR-874-3p overexpression-mediated effects on the viability and proinflammatory cytokines in SGBS adipocytes. MiR-874-3p alleviates TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory response in SGBS adipocytes by downregulating NCL and inactivating NF-\u03baB signaling.",

        "abstract": "HIV-associated lipodystrophy leads to visceral fat accumulation, metabolic complications, body image concerns, medication non-adherence, and increased cardiovascular risks. We thought to assess the effects of Tesamorelin, a synthetic growth hormone-releasing hormone analogue, that has been proposed as a targeted therapy. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL through July 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Tesamorelin versus placebo in adults with HIV. Random-effects meta-analysis was applied. Outcomes included changes in body composition, hepatic and metabolic parameters, hormonal markers, and adverse events. Risk of bias was assessed with RoB 2.0, and certainty of evidence with GRADE. Five RCTs evaluating Tesamorelin were included in the analysis. Tesamorelin was associated with significant reduction in visceral adipose tissue (MD=-27.71\u202fcm\u00b2, 95\u202f% CI [-38.37, -17.06]; P\u202f<\u202f0.001), trunk fat (MD=-1.18\u202fkg, 95\u202f% CI [-1.40, -0.96]; P\u202f<\u202f0.001), limb fat (MD=-0.22\u202fkg, 95\u202f% CI [-0.35, -0.08]; P\u202f=\u202f0.001), hepatic fat percentage (MD=-4.28\u202f%, 95\u202f% CI [-6.31, -2.24]; P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and waist circumference (MD=-1.61\u202fcm, 95\u202f% CI [-2.28, -0.95]; P\u202f<\u202f0.001). A significant increase in lean body mass was observed (MD=1.42\u202fkg, 95\u202f% CI [1.13, 1.71]; P\u202f<\u202f0.001). However, no significant reductions in subcutaneous adipose tissue or BMI were observed. Tesamorelin showed no significant change in CD4\u202f+\u202fT-cell counts. Tesamorelin was associated with adverse events, including arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia, and injection-site reactions like erythema. Tesamorelin improves body composition, hepatic fat, lean body mass, and IGF-1 levels in HIV-associated lipodystrophy, without serious side effects or perturbation of glucose.",

        "journal": "Obesity research & clinical practice",
        "abstract": "Excessive visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key driver of metabolic diseases, yet modifiable dietary strategies for VAT reduction remain underexplored. This cross-sectional study examined the association between dietary fiber intake and visceral fat volume in U.S. adults. Using 2011-2018 NHANES data from 9111 adults aged 20-59 years, dietary fiber intake was assessed via two 24-hour recalls, and VAT volume was measured by DXA. Weighted gamma regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and lifestyle factors evaluated dose-response relationships. Higher fiber intake was inversely associated with VAT volume (P for trend <0.001). Compared to the lowest intake group (<15\u202fg/day), adjusted VAT reductions were 4.1\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 2.3-5.9\u202f%), 7.6\u202f% (4.4-10.6\u202f%), and 6.8\u202f% (2.8-10.6\u202f%) for 15-25, 25-35, and >\u202f35\u202fg/day groups, respectively. Restricted cubic splines confirmed linearity (P\u202f=\u202f0.67), with stronger effects in females. Sensitivity analyses excluding extreme intake values (>60\u202fg/day) validated robustness. Increased dietary fiber intake is associated with lower visceral adiposity, suggesting a potential strategy for mitigating metabolic risk in U.S. adults.",

        "journal": "Translational oncology",
        "abstract": "Obesity is a non-communicable, multifactorial disorder that has steadily emerged as one of the major global health concerns. It significantly increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In obesity, the accumulation of excess fat causes increase in the circulatory levels of adipose tissue-specific hormones (adipokines) and exacerbates carbohydrate-fuelled metabolic stress. These factors promote oxidative and genotoxic stress, resulting in chronic inflammation. Moreover, obesity-related factors contribute to increase in DNA damage and disrupt the DNA Damage Response (DDR), thereby promoting genomic instability. Consequently, obesity may facilitate a complex, multi-step process of cellular transformation and cancer progression. However, the mechanisms linking obesity-associated DDR alterations to cancer progression are active areas of investigation. Therefore, elucidating these aspects of DDR in obesity could enhance our understanding of the risk assessment and facilitate advancement in treatment strategies for patients with cancers and obesity.",

        "title": "Genetic variation shapes the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcriptional responses in mouse adipose tissue.",
        "journal": "PLoS genetics",
        "abstract": "Most of the disease associated genetic variants identified in genome wide association studies have been mapped to the non-coding regions of the genome. One of the leading mechanisms by which these variants are thought to affect disease susceptibility is by altering transcription factor (TF) binding. Even though inbred mouse strains have been commonly used to investigate polygenic diseases, less is known on how their genetic differences translate to the level of gene regulation and chromatin landscape. Here, we investigated how genetic variation affects chromatin accessibility in the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ mice, which are commonly used to study diet-induced obesity, fed either chow or high-fat diet. We show that differences in chromatin accessibility are almost exclusively strain-specific and driven by genetic variation. In addition, we integrate ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) and H3K27ac ChIP-seq (active regulatory regions) data to show that tissue-specific TF binding sites are commonly found in the active regulatory regions hosting TF motif altering variants in eWAT. Using footprint analysis, we also show that TF occupancy is consistent with TF binding motif scores at the genetically altered loci. In addition, we validate these findings by extending the analysis to ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data obtained from the liver. We employ RNA-seq to show that differentially expressed genes are co-located with differentially accessible regions hosting genetic variants. Overall, our findings highlight the connection between differential chromatin accessibility and genetic variation across metabolically central tissues of a mouse model for polygenic obesity.",
