        "abstract": "Innate immune receptors detect molecular features of pathogen presence and cellular damage, enabling cells to mount anti-microbial defenses including the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Though classically studied in immunocytes, a remarkably broad range of innate immune receptor activity is now recognized in adipocytes, including that of Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, inflammasomes, and nucleic acid sensors such as cGAS-STING and RIG-I. These receptors influence adipocyte proinflammatory potential through control of secreted signaling factors that act in adipose tissue. Through less well understood mechanisms, they also influence adipocyte insulin sensitivity, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and thermogenesis. Innate immune receptors are activated by a diverse array of stimuli including circulating signaling factors and intracellular metabolic stresses, especially those related to mitochondrial function. The receptors are thus a potential means by which obesity-associated signals act through adipocytes to drive inflammation, adipose dysfunction, and metabolic disease pathogenesis.",

        "journal": "British journal of pharmacology",
        "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a clinical condition of ventricular dysfunction, with obesity and insulin resistance as the primary risk factors. Under this condition, the heart encounters lipotoxicity, which impairs cardiac insulin sensitivity and leads to cardiomyopathy. Angiotensin-(1-9) is a peptide of the counter-regulatory axis of the renin-angiotensin system with cardioprotective effects. However, its role in diabetic cardiomyopathy is unknown. To investigate the role of angiotensin-(1-9), we first induced lipotoxic stress in the heart by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice. Angiotensin-(1-9) was then administered for 4 weeks using osmotic mini-pumps. Cardiac function was assessed, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated in heart tissues after insulin bolus injection. Moreover, lipotoxic stress in vitro was modelled by high glucose medium plus palmitate in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Angiotensin-(1-9) improves myocardial function and reverts pathological cardiac remodelling under HFD feeding in mice. Moreover, angiotensin-(1-9) enhances whole-body glucose tolerance and reduces homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We demonstrate that angiotensin-(1-9) increases insulin sensitivity in the heart and skeletal muscle but not in adipose tissue or the liver. Mechanistically, angiotensin-(1-9) does not affect insulin signalling in cardiomyocytes at baseline, whereas it significantly improves insulin action under lipotoxic stress through AT<sub>2</sub> receptors and protein kinase A. These findings demonstrate that angiotensin-(1-9) improves cardiac function under metabolic challenge and promotes insulin signalling in cardiomyocytes under lipotoxicity, which may shed light on the therapeutic exploration against diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

        "title": "Obesity and asthma: obesity causes and aggravates asthma across the entire type-2 inflammation spectrum.",
        "journal": "The European respiratory journal",
        "abstract": "Obesity affects more than 650 million adults worldwide, with prevalence continuing to rise across all age groups and continents. This trend has important implications for asthma: individuals with obesity have a 30-50% higher risk of developing asthma, and obesity is highly prevalent among people with established disease. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) in clinical trials and registries of adults with asthma consistently ranges from 28-30 kg·m<sup>-2</sup>, with up to 70% of patients being overweight or obese. These numbers highlight obesity as one of the most common comorbidities in asthma, consistently associated with poorer asthma control and a higher risk of exacerbations. Although obesity-associated asthma is often described as Type-2 (T2)-low phenotype, it is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous condition not restricted to a single phenotype. Excess adiposity influences asthma through multiple mechanisms, including dysregulated adipokine signaling, impaired ILC2-eosinophil-macrophage crosstalk in adipose tissue, systemic low-grade inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and mechanical effects on lung volumes. This diversity complicates diagnosis, endotyping, and treatment stratification. Obesity should therefore be considered a treatable trait in asthma. Weight reduction - through lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery - improves symptoms, lung function, and exacerbation risk across both T2-high and T2-low asthma. Importantly, patients with obesity experience similar reductions in exacerbations with anti-T2 biologics as their lean counterparts, though improvements in symptoms and lung function are variable. Future research should prioritize randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP-agonist therapies specifically in patients with asthma and obesity, and elucidate how obesity modifies inflammatory endotypes and treatment responses.",

        "title": "GLP-1 RAs vs. SGLT2is: Divergent Pathways of Cardiovascular Inflammation Control in Obesity-Associated Diabetes.",
        "journal": "Annales d'endocrinologie",
        "abstract": "Diabesity, defined as the coexistence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, is a major global driver of cardiovascular disease through mechanisms of chronic low-grade meta-inflammation. Recent advances in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have demonstrated benefits that extend beyond glycemic control to encompass immunometabolic modulation. The present narrative review aimed to synthesize evidence on the anti-inflammatory pathways and cardiovascular benefits of these agents, focusing on their mechanistic overlap, divergence and clinical implications. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar was conducted for articles published between 2010 and 2024. Approximately 350 articles were screened, and 129 were included based on relevance to inflammation, diabesity and cardiovascular outcomes, integrating data from mechanistic studies, imaging substudies and randomized controlled trials. Evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs primarily attenuate inflammation through gut-brain-vascular signaling, endothelial transcriptional modulation, and macrophage polarization, whereas SGLT2is exert their effects via renal-hemodynamic reset, suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and reduction of epicardial adipose tissue. Both classes consistently lower levels of systemic cytokines such as IL-6 and hsCRP and improve endothelial function, collectively mitigating cardiometabolic risk. However, major outcome trials were not designed with inflammation as a primary endpoint, and no head-to-head studies have directly compared these agents for inflammatory outcomes. Critical research gaps include the need for standardized biomarker panels, advanced imaging modalities, and evaluation of combination therapy. Future research should focus on precision medicine approaches incorporating phenotyping, biomarker stratification and long-term inflammation-focused trials to optimize personalized treatment strategies for patients with diabesity.",

        "title": "TL1A serves as a positive regulator to promote adipocyte differentiation.",
        "journal": "PloS one",
        "abstract": "Adipogenesis, the intricate process of differentiation from preadipocytes or mesenchymal stem cells into mature adipocytes, is crucial for the formation and metabolic function of adipose tissues in mammals. The TNF ligand-related molecule 1A (TL1A) is a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF superfamily. Inflammation is involved in the whole process of adipocyte cell formation and obesity development. To investigate the potential influence of TL1A on adipocyte development, we examined mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and 3T3-L1 cells. Our findings indicated that TL1A-treated MEFs exhibited an elevated rate of spontaneous adipogenesis, with a significant enhancement in adipocyte formation upon induction with a combination of insulin, dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine. This increased adipogenesis was evidenced by augmented lipid droplet formation and elevated expression of several adipogenic markers. Specifically, there was an upregulation of early-stage adipogenesis genes, including Krox20, KLF5, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, as well as late-stage adipogenesis regulators such as KLF15, C/EBPα, PPARγ and aP2. Moreover, TL1A significantly upregulated the protein expression of adipogenic markers (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPARγ, CD36 and aP2) in MEFs and 3T3-L1 cells. Mechanistically, TL1A enhanced the phosphorylation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), which led to cytoplasmic retention. Ultimately, TL1A inhibited the stabilization and nuclear transfer of β-catenin in MEFs, probably through regulating the upstream protein YAP1. Taken together, TL1A promoted adipogenic differentiation of MEFs and 3T3-L1 cells in vitro, which partly via inhibiting YAP1 mediated β-catenin signaling pathway.",
