        "journal": "Nature communications",
        "abstract": "How cellular metabolism facilitates tissue-resident macrophage maintenance remains elusive. Here we show that visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-resident macrophages, unlike monocyte-derived macrophages, are enriched with mitochondrial-specific antioxidant enzymes restraining inflammation and promoting VAT homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Additionally, VAT resident macrophages express high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, encoded by SerpinB2, which is involved in the blood coagulation cascade. SerpinB2 promotes adipose resident macrophage survival by regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and preventing the release of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm via antioxidant glutathione production. Chronic inflammation, such as obesity, diminishes SerpinB2 expression in VAT macrophages in patients and mice, leading to the decline of this macrophage subset. Mechanistically, interferon-γ elevation in diabetes induces Ikaros, a transcriptional suppressor, which binds to the SerpinB2 promoter and decreases SerpinB2 expression. Congruently, selective depletion of the IFN-γ receptor in myeloid cells or supplementation of macrophage-specific SerpinB2 deficient mice with N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor, restores VAT resident macrophage survival, decreases adipocyte size, and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Our data thus reveal an unexpected function of SerpinB2 in the regulation of mitochondrial function and survival of tissue-resident macrophages.",

        "title": "Managing Obesity in Heart Failure Patients: Current Evidence and Strategies.",
        "journal": "The American journal of cardiology",
        "abstract": "Obesity, characterized by excessive accumulation of adipose tissue, is associated with numerous health risks including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Obesity affects a massive portion of the global population, with a projected increase in prevalence by 2035. It leads to various cardiovascular events, insulin resistance, and increased inflammation, all of which predispose individuals to heart failure. Addressing obesity can significantly improve these patients' functional status and quality of life. Effective management of obesity in heart failure patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. Management strategies for obesity in heart failure patients include physical therapy, nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic bariatric surgery. In conclusion, this review summarizes current evidence in the management of obesity and related complications in patients with end-stage heart failure and explores candidacy for advanced therapies such as heart transplants or durable left ventricular assist devices if native heart recovery is not feasible.",

        "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology",
        "abstract": "Obesity remains a major global health challenge, and current pharmacotherapies have limitations in long-term efficacy, safety, and cost. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) seeds are a rich source of sulforaphane (SFN), which has demonstrated anti-obesity effects. However, the bioavailability of SFN from broccoli seeds is limited by suboptimal conversion conditions and competing nitrile-formation pathways. This study aims to standardize a high-yield, SFN-rich broccoli seed hydrolysate (BSH), to evaluate its anti-obesity efficacy in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and to elucidate its mechanism via molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD). SFN hydrolysis was optimized by Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) across pH, temperature, time, and L-ascorbic acid; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT2A) binding was probed by network pharmacology, molecular docking, and 100 ns MD. HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 per group) received oral broccoli seed water extract (BWE), BSH, or SFN for 8 weeks. Anti-obesity efficacy was assessed by body/tissue weights, micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), histology, and serum lipid profiling, while 5-HT2A, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and other markers in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and liver were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. SFN production from broccoli seeds was maximized under two hydrolysis regimes: short-term (pH 4 at 35°C for 2 h) and long-term (pH 5 at 25°C for 24 h). In silico analyses predicted stable binding of the sulforaphane-glutathione conjugate (SFN-GSH) to 5-HT2A. In HFD-fed mice, BSH (40-800 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently attenuated HFD-induced body weight gain (800 mg/kg vs HFD, p < 0.001). BWE 400 mg/kg and BSH 40 mg/kg showed broadly comparable effects on body weight. Furthermore, gene and protein analyses in eWAT and liver showed 5-HT2A (Htr2a) suppression, restored AMPK phosphorylation, and downregulation of lipogenic regulators. However, co-administration of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C (5 mg/kg, i.p.) with BSH abolished these BSH-induced effects. Oral administration of a sulforaphane standard (1-10 mg/kg) produced similar effects to BSH (10 mg/kg vs HFD, p < 0.01), suggesting that the anti-obesity effect of BSH is mediated primarily by SFN. In this study, SFN-rich BSH ameliorated obesity in HFD-fed mice via a peripheral 5-HT2A suppression-AMPK activation axis. However, further mechanistic clarification will require studies to more precisely define the role of 5-HT2A in adipocytes.",

        "title": "GLP-1 is not enough: can glucagon fill the energy expenditure gap?",
        "journal": "Neuroendocrinology",
        "abstract": "Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure (EE). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, reduce weight through appetite suppression but exert minimal influence on EE, potentially limiting long-term efficacy due to adaptive declines in metabolic rate. In contrast, glucagon, traditionally regarded as a glucose counter-regulatory hormone, has emerged as a potent catabolic signal with actions on lipid oxidation, substrate mobilization, and EE. These properties position glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists as complements to GLP-1R agonism, with the potential to close the EE gap in obesity pharmacotherapy. This review examines glucagon as an endocrine regulator of EE, integrating evidence from historical, preclinical, and clinical studies. Preclinical models demonstrate that glucagon increases oxygen consumption, stimulates brown adipose tissue, and promotes endocrine pathways including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine that increases EE by enhancing lipid oxidation and thermogenic gene programs. Human studies reveal modest and context-dependent effects, with glucagon administration increasing EE in fasted or insulin-deficient states, whereas the response is attenuated postprandially or under hyperinsulinemia. This translational gap highlights the complexity of glucagon biology and the challenges of leveraging it therapeutically. Nevertheless, GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonism has demonstrated superior weight-loss efficacy in clinical trials and is advancing toward clinical application. Glucagon complements the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1 by engaging metabolic pathways that promote catabolism and EE. While preclinical evidence is strong, human data remain limited and context dependent. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of emerging GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists and to determine whether combining appetite suppression with the catabolic effects of glucagon can achieve durable, muscle-sparing weight loss in people living with obesity.",

        "title": "Cardiometabolic Syndromes and Associated Cardiovascular Risks: A Narrative Review.",
        "journal": "Journal of vascular research",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular risk (CVR) represents a major global health challenge due to its strong association with metabolic and endocrine disorders. Conditions such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), cardiorenometabolic syndrome (CKM), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) share overlapping but distinct clinical and pathophysiological features. Common mechanisms include insulin resistance, adipose tissue dysfunction, low-grade inflammation, and lipid abnormalities, which collectively contribute to vascular injury and cardiometabolic progression. MetS reflects central obesity often accompanied by hypertension and dyslipidaemia, while HTGW identifies visceral adiposity and metabolic imbalance. MASLD, formerly known as NAFLD, is now recognised as an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. CKM encompasses the continuum of metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular dysfunction with additive effects on global risk. PCOS, prevalent among women of reproductive age, involves metabolic and hormonal disturbances that promote endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. This review synthesises current evidence linking these entities within a unified cardiometabolic framework and highlights the need for integrated risk stratification. Precision medicine approaches combining clinical, biochemical, and imaging biomarkers may allow early identification of subclinical phenotypes, enabling timely and targeted interventions to modify disease trajectories and reduce long-term cardiovascular burden.",
