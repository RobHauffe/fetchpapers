        "abstract": "Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction (BBTD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, is prescribed for phlegm-dampness syndromes, including cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension and obesity. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying BBTD's anti-obesity effect against adipose tissue (AT) inflammation, however, remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of BBTD and investigate its underlying molecular mechanism. We induced obesity with a high-fat diet (HFD) and then used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cellular landscape of cells from epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) of mice in Normal, Model and BBTD groups. The Model group exhibited an aberrant increase in adipocyte size and lipid accumulation, alongside AT metabolic dysfunction. Administration of a high concentration of BBTD largely reversed these alterations. snRNA-seq of eWAT further revealed that HFD feeding promoted the accumulation of inflammatory factors and AT macrophages (ATMs), as well as complex adipocyte-macrophage communication. BBTD significantly attenuated AT inflammation by suppressing interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R) positive LAMs infiltration and cell interactions. Here, we highlight the therapeutic potential of BBTD in anti-obesity through improving AT microenvironment.",

        "journal": "Medicine",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a multifaceted metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, arising from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Beyond its well-documented metabolic underpinnings, emerging evidence has illuminated a pivotal role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), disrupt insulin signaling, impair β-cell function, and exacerbate insulin resistance. Chronic low-grade inflammation serves as a unifying mechanism linking obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and diabetes progression. The interplay between inflammatory pathways and diabetes extends to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune-mediated β-cell destruction is driven by inflammatory cytokines and dysregulated immune responses, while in type 2 diabetes, systemic and adipose tissue inflammation perpetuate insulin resistance and β-cell stress. Key molecular players, including toll-like receptors, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, act as mediators between metabolic stress and inflammatory responses, emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and hyperglycemia.",

        "journal": "European journal of medical research",
        "abstract": "Acteoside, a phenylethanol glycoside, possesses various pharmacological properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of its anti-obesity effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, as well as to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of its two active metabolites, caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol. Mice were randomly divided into six groups in the first part experiment and five groups in the second part experiment as follows: control diet group; control diet + acteoside at 150 mg/kg/day group; HFD group; HFD + orlistat at 20 mg/kg/day group; HFD + caffeic acid at 45 mg/kg/day group; HFD + hydroxytyrosol at 40 mg/kg/day group; HFD + acteoside at 75 mg/kg/day group; and HFD + acteoside at 150 mg/kg/day group. The results showed that acteoside exhibited more pronounced anti-obesity effects compared with its two active metabolites. Acteoside supplementation reduced body weight and white adipose tissue (WAT) weight and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese mice, as well as partially reverse hepatic damage and fat accumulation. In addition, acteoside induced the production of brown adipose tissue (BAT) when compared with caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol, as well as promote a thermogenesis program in BAT and activate AMPK and HSL signaling in both WAT and BAT. Furthermore, high-dose acteoside supplementation altered the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in obese mice. In summary, our results indicate that long-term acteoside supplementation may partially reverse obesity by stimulating adipose thermogenesis, modulating lipid metabolism, and altering the gut microbiota.",

        "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta. Gene regulatory mechanisms",
        "abstract": "Ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2) catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, facilitating active DNA demethylation. Although implicated in adipogenesis, its precise role remains controversial. Here, we investigated Tet2 function during early 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, focusing on regulation of the imprinted gene Pref-1. Differentiation time-course experiments revealed that Tet2 protein, but not mRNA, was progressively reduced via proteasome-dependent degradation, contrasting with previous reports of Tet2 mRNA upregulation. Tet2 overexpression delayed lipid accumulation and reduced adipogenic marker expression, whereas knockdown had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, Tet2 positively regulated Pref-1 transcription by demethylating specific differentially methylated regions in its promoter and exon 6. Loss of Tet2 increased DNA methylation and decreased hydroxymethylation at these loci, leading to Pref-1 repression and derepression of C/EBPα and PPARγ. This stage-specific, proteasome-mediated downregulation of Tet2 integrates epigenetic and post-translational control to regulate adipocyte commitment. The Tet2-Pref-1 axis offers mechanistic insight into adipose tissue expansion and may represent a therapeutic target for obesity and imprinting-related disorders.",

        "abstract": "GPR75, a G protein-coupled receptor implicated in human obesity through loss-of-function variants, has emerged as a promising regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis. To dissect its tissue-specific functions, we generated a humanized floxed <i>Gpr75</i> mouse model with conditional deletions in the brain and adipose tissue. Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts. These findings position GPR75 as a critical regulator of central energy balance and provide a mechanistic framework for developing brain-targeted therapies against obesity.",
