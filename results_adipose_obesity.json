        "abstract": "Exposure to 'metabolic disrupting chemicals' (MDCs) are increasingly implicated in obesity, diabetes and/or fatty liver disease; indeed, these metabolic changes may play a role in the global metabolic disorders' epidemic. To better assess and manage the health risks of MDCs, improved hazard identification is needed. This review describes how current in vivo OECD Test Guidelines (TGs) can better capture MDC effects. The biological and clinical evidence to support the inclusion of promising human relevant biomarkers, blood parameters, endpoints and relevant tissues for MDCs for potential inclusion in OECD TGs is documented. Current clinical chemistry routine requirements could be utilised further, and the additional assessment of relevant hormones such as a decrease in adiponectin, increase in resistin and leptin, which impact satiety, could be additionally included. Additionally, assessment of fatty tissue distribution in alert animals and insulin resistance, is recommended, and histological parameters in relation to the different types of adipose tissue. How specific biomarkers and endpoints could be incorporated into OECD mammalian in vivo assays, and how they can be included in the EU strategy for Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals identification and the forthcoming update to the OECD Guidance Document on the Testing and Assessment of Endocrine Disruption chemicals, are discussed.",

        "title": "Ferroptosis in heart failure: from molecular insights to therapeutic implications.",
        "journal": "Cardiovascular research",
        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is the form of regulated cell death driven by iron-induced lipid peroxidation, implicated in different cardiovascular diseases and especially heart failure. It is an abundant form of regulated cell death in the myocardium of many heart failure animal models, including the chronic ischemic, pressure overload, diabetic, septic, obesity-related and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy models. Across these models, disordered iron handling, antioxidant failure, enzymatic phospholipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial stress converge on ferroptosis, leading to contractile dysfunction and adverse remodelling. Although definitive causality between ferroptosis and heart failure has not yet been established, emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis contributes to heart failure progression, supported by multi-layer rescue with classic inhibitors (ferrostatin-1, liproxstatin-1, iron chelators) and by cardiometabolic drugs with clinical efficacy in heart failure (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitors, sacubitril/valsartan, finerenone, levosimendan, nicorandil) as well as polyphenols, which restore systolic and/or diastolic indices and reverse remodelling. Early human evidence aligns, showing that human failing myocardial and epicardial adipose tissue exhibit ferroptosis-specific transcriptional and lipidomic signatures, while circulating biomarkers and tissue profiles of patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors indicate reduced ferroptosis activity. In this review, through critical synthesis of existing evidence, we analyse current literature, discuss translational barriers and propose a new conceptual mechanistic framework - \"the ferroptosis nexus\" - wherein iron mobilization, antioxidant collapse, lipid priming, and mitochondrial/calcium amplifiers form a self-reinforcing loop culminating in pump failure. Standardized ferroptosis signatures, single cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis, and mechanism-driven clinical trials are needed to identify responsive heart failure phenotypes and translate ferroptosis modulation into precision cardioprotection.",

        "title": "From Selection Signatures in Cattle to Functional Validation in Mice: HSPA12B Negatively Regulates Adipose Browning and Thermogenesis.",
        "journal": "Journal of animal science",
        "abstract": "Local cattle breeds have been domesticated and adapted to various climatic environments through natural and artificial selection. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation remain unknown. Adipose tissue browning may play a crucial role in this adaptation. Our analysis of 777K SNP genotyping data from 25 local Chinese cattle breeds revealed that the HSPA12B (heat shock protein A12B) gene underwent positive selection in Chinese northern cold-adapted breeds and Tibetan Plateau breeds. The results of the Western blot experiment showed that HSPA12B was highly expressed in adipose tissues of cattle and mice, with a relatively high expression level in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) of mice. Following cold induction, the expression of HSPA12B was upregulated in both the iBAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice. We generated a Hspa12b knockout mouse model, and qRT-PCR data analysis showed that the deletion of Hspa12b promoted adipose browning thermogenesis by increasing the expression of Elovl3 and Ucp1 (P＜0.05) at low temperature. Protein-protein interaction prediction results showed that interactions exist between HSPA12B and ELOVL3 in both mice and cattle. Furthermore, glucose and insulin tolerance testing experiments showd that the deletion of Hspa12b promoted glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (P＜0.05) in mice. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that HSPA12B acts as a negative regulator of adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis, and this regulatory effect is mediated through the modulation of ELOVL3 expression. Moreover, HSPA12B is activated by low temperatures, which acts as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent excessive browning of fat and to maintain body temperature. These findings offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation in animals and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human obesity and diabetes.",

        "journal": "Molecular medicine reports",
        "abstract": "In 2022, the World Health Organization estimated that globally, ~2.5 billion adults were overweight, including 890 million individuals with obesity. Adipose tissue dysfunction in obese individuals is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Within the present study, the association between serum levels of C1q/TNF‑related protein 4 (CTRP4) and insulin resistance (IR) in overweight/obese patients was investigated and the effects and mechanisms of CTRP4 on IR in dexamethasone‑induced 3T3‑L1 adipocytes were evaluated. A total of 98 overweight/obese patients were enrolled in the present study. Serum CTRP4 concentration levels were measured with ELISA kits. Correlations between CTRP4 and the <i>homeostatic model assessment of IR</i> (HOMA‑IR) were evaluated using Spearman's correlation analysis. Recombinant CTRP4 protein was administered to fully differentiated 3T3‑L1 adipocytes to explore the impact of CTRP4 on lipid accumulation. In addition, the effects of CTRP4 on restoring impaired glucose uptake were examined through the glucose oxidase‑peroxidase method. Molecular marker expression levels in the insulin signaling pathway, in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with IR induced by 1 µM dexamethasone, were also examined, through western blotting. The expression levels of CTRP4 exhibited a negative association with body mass index (r=‑0.35; P<0.001), HOMA‑IR (r=‑0.24; P=0.048), waist circumference (r=‑0.38; P<0.001) and abdomen circumference (r=‑0.39; P<0.001). Following treatment of cells with recombinant CTRP4, a significant reduction in lipid accumulation was observed in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes, alongside with an increase in the glucose uptake rate in dexamethasone‑induced 3T3‑L1 adipocytes (all, P<0.05). Furthermore, a marked elevation in the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1), PI3K and AKT phosphorylation and GLUT4 was observed in the IR model of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Serum CTRP4 concentration levels were negatively correlated with IR in overweight/obese patients. CTRP4 suppressed lipid accumulation and promoted glucose uptake through the IRS‑1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and caused increased GLUT4 expression in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes.8.",

        "journal": "BMC medicine",
        "abstract": "It remains unclear whether reengaging in lifestyle weight loss interventions is effective for the long-term. We conducted the CENTRAL (trial 1, T1) lifestyle weight-loss trial in 2012-2014, and the DIRECT-PLUS (trial 2, T2) weight-loss trial in 2017-2018. All participants were invited for follow-up in 2022-2024 to assess weight, metabolic biomarkers, and fat depots via magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) five years after the second trial. The analysis included 572 trial observations contributed by 480 participants; of these, 388 participated in one of the two trials and 92 participated in both (T1 + T2 rejoiners). At follow-up, 384/480 (80%) were re-evaluated, including 76/92 (83%) rejoiners. In T1, participants who participated once and those who later rejoined T2 exhibited similar responses to their first intervention, including comparable weight-loss (-3.3% vs. -3.4%; FDR = 0.93). However, T1 + T2 rejoiners began their second intervention with a similar baseline BMI to their first (31.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 31.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; FDR = 0.12). Nevertheless, they presented a more favourable abdominal fat and metabolic profiles at T2 baseline than at their initial T1 baseline (visceral adipose tissue (VAT): 135.5 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 160.0 cm<sup>2</sup>; homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR): 3.8 vs. 4.5; high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)/Triglycerides: 3.6 vs. 4.2; all FDR < 0.05). In response to T2, rejoiners exhibited attenuated improvements compared to those achieved during their previous T1 intervention (weight: -1.5% vs. -3.5%; VAT: -7.2% vs. -33.3%; deep subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT): -4.0% vs. -31.9%; superficial SAT: -3.3% vs. -25.4%; all FDR < 0.05), and compared to first-time T2 participants (weight: -3.5%; FDR < 0.05, VAT: -11.6%; FDR = 0.20, deep SAT: -9.9%; FDR < 0.05, superficial SAT: -9.3%; FDR = 0.05). Yet, 5 years after completing T2, T1 + T2 rejoiners exhibited significantly less weight regain compared with first-time T2 participants (+ 0.2% vs. + 2.9%; FDR < 0.05), deep-SAT regain (+ 2.4% vs. + 13.3%; FDR < 0.05), and superficial-SAT regain (+ 12.8% vs. + 24.3%; FDR < 0.05), though similar VAT regain. Overall, although T1 + T2 rejoiners had higher baseline obesity parameters than first-time participants, they presented comparable values by the 5- and 10-year follow-up. Despite an attenuated weight-loss response, repeated engagement in a structured lifestyle intervention yields meaningful long-term impacts with sustainable metabolic benefits.
