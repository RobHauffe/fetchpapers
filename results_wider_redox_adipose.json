        "journal": "International journal of food sciences and nutrition",
        "abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular complications, represent a major global health burden. A key pathogenic mechanism linking these conditions is the overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which triggers caspase-1 activation and promotes proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18), driving adipose tissue dysfunction, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Emerging evidence highlights dietary polyphenols as natural modulators of NLRP3 activity attenuating inflammasome activation by regulating NF-κB signalling, reducing oxidative stress and restoring autophagy. Complementary <i>in silico</i> approaches (e.g., molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, network pharmacology) provide mechanistic insights into polyphenol-inflammasome interactions. This review summarises current evidence on the NLRP3's role in obesity-related disorders and discusses the therapeutic potential of dietary polyphenols, underscoring directions for translational and multidisciplinary research.",

        "title": "Insulin resistance induced by obesity: Mechanisms, metabolic implications and therapeutic approaches.",
        "journal": "Molecular biology reports",
        "abstract": "Obesity-induced insulin resistance is an escalating global health challenge that substantially contributes to the development of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. This narrative review critically examines the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking excess adiposity to impaired insulin action, with a particular focus on adipose tissue dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, covering preclinical and clinical studies published primarily over the past two decades. Evidence indicates that adipocyte hypertrophy and hypoxia promote excessive free fatty acid release, ectopic lipid accumulation, and lipotoxicity, thereby disrupting insulin signalling pathways. Numerous clinical studies report that obesity triggers chronic, low-grade inflammation in the liver and pancreas, activating pathways such as NF-κB and SOCS proteins, thereby disrupting insulin signalling. Concurrently, obesity-associated inflammation drives immune cell infiltration and macrophage polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, further exacerbating insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. This review also synthesizes current therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, including insulin-sensitizing agents, anti-inflammatory therapies, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, as well as emerging approaches. Future perspectives highlight the growing relevance of personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, digital health tools, and gene-based interventions in improving therapeutic precision. A deeper understanding of these interconnected pathways is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate obesity-related insulin resistance and its global metabolic consequences.",

        "journal": "Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",
        "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity, where excess body fat coexists with reduced muscle mass and function, is becoming increasingly common in ageing populations and contributes to poor physical and metabolic health. Although adipose tissue-secreted factors are implicated in muscle decline, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which carry regulatory cargo such as microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells, may play a key role in this adipose-muscle communication. EVs were isolated from adipose-conditioned media (ACM) collected from lean and non-lean human donors using ultracentrifugation. Donors were grouped by BMI (lean: 20.7-24.4; non-lean: 25.3-39.3) and age (younger: 31-56 years; older: 60-84 years). EVs were characterised using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), ExoView, nanoscale flow cytometry (CytoFLEX Nano) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Primary human myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes and treated for 24 h with lean or non-lean EVs (1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL) or left untreated. Myotube thickness was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy. Transcriptomic changes were assessed by bulk RNA sequencing. EV miRNA cargo was profiled by small RNA-seq and validated by qPCR. The role of miR-150-5p was tested using antagomir inhibition. Non-lean EVs significantly reduced myotube thickness in older adult-derived myotubes compared to both untreated controls (8.7 ± 1.66 μm vs. 12.4 ± 1.72 μm, p < 0.01) and lean EV-treated myotubes (8.7 ± 1.66 μm vs. 13.2 ± 3.84 μm, p < 0.05), indicating a donor BMI-specific effect. This atrophy was restricted to myotubes derived from older donors. The same experimental approach was applied to younger adult-derived myotubes; no reduction in myotube thickness was observed. MAFbx expression was significantly increased in response to non-lean EVs (p < 0.05). RNA-seq revealed 471 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EV-treated versus untreated cells and 293 DEGs between lean and non-lean EV conditions, with enrichment in inflammatory (TNF and IL1B), oxidative stress, mitochondrial and chromatin pathways. Small RNA-seq identified seven differentially expressed miRNAs (annotated using miRBase release 22.1), including miR-150-5p and miR-193b-5p, both significantly upregulated in non-lean EVs and validated by qPCR. Inhibiting miR-150-5p partially rescued myotube thickness (10.5 ± 1.37 μm vs. 8.7 ± 1.66 μm, p < 0.05) and reduced MAFbx expression. EVs from non-lean adipose tissue drive muscle atrophy and transcriptional changes in an age-dependent manner. These effects are partially mediated by miR-150-5p, highlighting a mechanistic role for EV cargo in adipose-muscle signalling. Targeting EV-derived miRNAs may offer a novel strategy to combat muscle loss in obesity and ageing.",

        "title": "Synergistic Anti-Inflammatory Effects and Efficient Weight Loss through the Combination of Chinese Herbs and Photothermal Therapy in Obesity Treatment.",
        "journal": "ACS applied bio materials",
        "abstract": "The global rise in obesity rates presents a pressing international challenge. Despite substantial investments and research endeavors in pharmaceutical treatments for obesity, the use of high doses over extended periods has resulted in a spectrum of difficult-to-manage side effects. In this study, we introduce a novel photothermal-pharmacotherapy approach that combines a near-infrared absorbing aggregation-induced emissive (AIE) photothermal agent with the Chinese herbal medicine, morin. The AIE photothermal agent generates heat upon laser exposure to target and eliminate adipocytes, while morin reduces reactive oxygen species levels in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), the injection site, exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that mitigate potential heat-induced inflammation. Our findings reveal that morin can act as a synergistic photothermal codriving agent, enhancing adipocyte destruction. Remarkably, compared to the control group, the photothermal-pharmacotherapy group shows a 20% reduction in body weight, along with decreases of 17.9% in liver weight, 44.1% in epididymal white fat, 38.9% in mesenteric white fat, 45.7% in retroperitoneal white fat, and 68.4% in subcutaneous white fat in mice. Overall, this research underscores the efficacy of combining AIE photothermal agents with natural Chinese herbal compounds as a promising strategy for anti-inflammatory interventions and offers insights into combating obesity.",

        "journal": "Materials today. Bio",
        "abstract": "Obesity represents a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by adipose tissue dysfunction that drives systemic metabolic derangements and promotes tumor progression. Adipose inflammation, dominated by pro-inflammatory macrophages and dysregulated adipokine secretion, not only impairs lipid metabolism but also suppresses anti-tumor immunity. Although anti-obesity medications (AOMs) can induce weight loss, their limited ability to resolve inflammation constrains long-term metabolic and oncologic benefits. Recent advances in nanomedicine have enabled targeted modulation of adipose tissue through enhanced drug bioavailability, controlled release, and remodeling of the immune microenvironment. This review summarizes recent progress in anti-inflammatory nanomedicines for obesity and their potential to synergize with cancer therapy. Specifically, we discuss nanomedicines that alleviate adipose inflammation <i>via</i> macrophage reprogramming, cytokine silencing, or reactive oxygen species scavenging, as well as those that promote white adipose tissue browning and brown adipose tissue activation and thermogenesis. By elucidating the interplay between adipose inflammation, metabolic regulation, and cancer immunotherapy, we propose that natural compounds and drug-free nanomaterials targeting adipose inflammation may serve as a critical foundation for next-generation nanotherapeutics, offering a dual-benefit strategy to combat obesity and enhance cancer immunotherapy efficacy.",
